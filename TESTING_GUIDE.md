## üîç Backend API Testing

### API Documentation
Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Try These Endpoints:
```bash
# Get all students
GET http://localhost:8000/api/students

# Get all exams
GET http://localhost:8000/api/exams

# Get schedules for specific date
GET http://localhost:8000/api/schedules?date=2025-11-08

# Get schedules for specific exam
GET http://localhost:8000/api/schedules?exam_id=1
```

## üêõ What to Test For

### ‚úÖ Expected Behaviors
- Students grouped correctly by branch/semester
- No student appears twice on same date/time
- Batch numbers increment correctly
- Filters work properly
- CSV/PDF exports contain correct data
- Upload forms accept valid CSV files
- Delete operations work
- **NEW**: Edit modal opens when clicking edit icon
- **NEW**: Student moves between batches successfully
- **NEW**: Collision prevention works during edits
- **NEW**: Student counts update after moves

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases to Try
- Generate schedule with 0 time slots (should error)
- Generate schedule for date outside exam range
- Upload CSV with duplicate registration numbers
- Try to schedule same exam twice on same date
- Delete a schedule and verify student count updates

## üìà Performance Testing

Try generating schedules with:
- Very small batches (2 students) ‚Üí Many batches created
- Very large batches (20 students) ‚Üí Few batches created
- Multiple exams on consecutive dates
- All 6 exams scheduled on different dates

## üéì Advanced Testing

### Scenario: Full Week Schedule
Generate schedules for all 6 exams across different dates:
1. CSL331 on Nov 5
2. CSL332 on Nov 6
3. CSL333 on Nov 7
4. CSL334 on Nov 8
5. CSL335 on Nov 9
6. ISL331 on Nov 10

Then use Dashboard filters to view each day's schedule!

## üîÑ Reset Database

To start fresh:
```bash
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
# Delete database file
del lab_scheduler.db

# Restart backend
python main.py

# Re-run seed script
python seed_data.py
```

## üìû Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No students found" when generating
**Solution**: Run `python seed_data.py` again

### Issue: Frontend not loading
**Solution**: Check if `npm start` is running on port 3000

### Issue: CORS error
**Solution**: Ensure backend is running on port 8000

### Issue: Schedule generation fails
**Solution**: Check that exam dates are valid and students exist

## üéâ Success Criteria

You'll know everything works if you can:
1. ‚úÖ See 40 students in Students tab
2. ‚úÖ See 6 exams in Exams tab
3. ‚úÖ Generate a schedule successfully
4. ‚úÖ View schedules in Dashboard with color coding
5. ‚úÖ **Edit a batch and move students** between batches
6. ‚úÖ **Collision prevention** blocks invalid moves
7. ‚úÖ Export CSV and PDF files
8. ‚úÖ Filter schedules by date/exam
9. ‚úÖ No student conflicts (double booking)
10. ‚úÖ Student counts update dynamically
