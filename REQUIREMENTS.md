# Lab Exam Scheduler - Requirements Specification

## Goal
Build a full-stack web app for an engineering teacher to schedule lab exams for college students automatically, ensuring no collisions.

## Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI) + SQLite
- **Export**: CSV and PDF

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose

Allow the teacher to:
- ‚úÖ Select exam and date
- ‚úÖ Automatically divide students into batches for labs
- ‚úÖ Respect max students per batch, customizable time slots, and branch/semester grouping
- ‚úÖ Avoid scheduling collisions (no student in overlapping labs)
- ‚úÖ Editable schedules in case adjustments are needed
- ‚úÖ Support multiple exams per day
- ‚úÖ Upload new student/exam data via CSV/Excel
- ‚úÖ Modern table view for easy reading, with export options

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Database Schema

### students
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| reg_no | TEXT (PK) | e.g., MES23CS001 |
| name | TEXT | Full student name |
| branch | TEXT | e.g., CSE-A |
| semester | INTEGER | e.g., 5 |

### exams
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| exam_id | INTEGER (PK) | Unique exam ID |
| subject_code | TEXT | e.g., CSL331 |
| subject_name | TEXT | e.g., System Software & Microprocessor Lab |
| lab_no | TEXT | e.g., LAB 4 |
| date_start | DATE | Earliest exam date |
| date_end | DATE | Last exam date |
| examiner_internal | TEXT | Internal examiner |
| examiner_external | TEXT | External examiner |

### schedules
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| schedule_id | INTEGER (PK) | Unique schedule ID |
| exam_id | INTEGER (FK ‚Üí exams) | Linked exam |
| date | DATE | Exam date |
| time_slot | TEXT | e.g., "09:30‚Äì12:30" |
| total_students | INTEGER | Students in this batch |

### schedule_students
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER (PK) | Unique row ID |
| schedule_id | INTEGER (FK ‚Üí schedules.schedule_id) | Linked schedule |
| reg_no | TEXT (FK ‚Üí students.reg_no) | Student reg_no |

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Scheduler Logic

Teacher selects exam and date, optionally defines time slots.

### Backend automatically:
1. Groups students by branch/semester
2. Divides into batches based on max students per batch
3. Assigns batches to time slots
4. Checks existing schedules for collisions across all exams on that day
5. Saves schedule in `schedules` + `schedule_students`

### Frontend displays:
- Modern, editable table
- Color-coded by branch/semester
- Options to move students between batches
- Real-time collision validation
